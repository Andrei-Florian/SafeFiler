# Overview
Individuals and companies have filers, to keep their documents, some filers contain very secret and important files that you would not want to be tampered with by some person that got the key to your office.

What stops your "colleague" from searching your filer for that document that will get him the promotion? What stops your parents from eyeing your test results? SafeFiler aims to revolutionise your filer, if you are a company or just a person with a filer, SafeFiler will turn your old filer into a shiny, smart, connected device.

The owner of the filer can lock it by just pressing a button on the go, on the phone application. And no, the filer will not be locked by a huge magnetic lock that can be ripped off, it will emit a high frequency alarm that will make that "colleague" put the filler back. The user can also log the number of pages in each section of the filer through the phon app, this data is also visible on the device and on an online dashboard. Packed with tonnes of cool features, SafeFiler makes filing a little funner.
